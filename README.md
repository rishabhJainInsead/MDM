Decision Making Framework

Go through decision process checks

1. Have we considered our fundamental objectives? What are we trying to achieve?

2. Have we expanded our view and considered multiple perspectives? Have we thought creatively and considered many alternatives, beyond the most evident ones?

3. What is missing from our analysis? Where is the gorilla? What is it that we do not know? What do we wish we knew? What additional information would help inform our decision? How can we get this information?

4. Have we sought for evidence that contradicts our beliefs?

5. Have we reality-tested our assumptions? What if we are wrong?

6. Are we doing what we believe works or what really works? How can we test our ideas and beliefs with some quick experiments?

7. Is it a true pattern or a cinnamon roll?

8. Have we considered all relevant uncertainties - even those that appear highly improbable?

9. What are potential coconuts/black swans? What are the main threats? Opportunities?

10. Have we included redundancy in our system to account for (un)known unknowns?

11. How confident or optimistic are we in our assessment of the situation? If highly confident, go back to questions 1-13.

12. Does irrational escalation of commitment play a role in our decision? Are we overcommitted?

13. Groups: Who has what kind of knowledge? Why do we all agree? Could it be because we are all similarly wrong?

14. Groups: Has there been any/enough disagreement and divergent thinking in the group? How can we further explore individual points of view in the group?

15. How does our decision align with our values and ethical considerations? To which extent is this decision ethical? Unethical? Can we think of other options that would be more in line with our values?

16. What am I feeling? How might emotions be influencing our decision? Is it the right moment to make any decision? Are we putting unnecessary time constraints on our thinking process which increase emotions? Have we given ourselves enough time to consider all alternatives.
